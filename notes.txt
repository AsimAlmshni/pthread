the speed up is : 
	with 10 threads
	serial time / parallel time
	.027 / .037

when ive run ten threads i got this
when run 20 thread i got this
	the run time changed to .024
	speed up is .027 / .024
when rum 30 thread i got this 
	the run time is .026
	speed up is .027 / .026
when run 50 thread i got 
	the run time is .027
	speed up is   .027 / .027

okay the perfomance has channged sometimes it's got be better than other 
i think it migth be the evalutating of loops that's it's determind by me 
i think it may be better with another syncroniztion tool
